### Changed
- Show a warning when using Arch Linux styled architectures (those can be seen from the output of `uname -p`). Such architectures are still allowed for builds, but makedeb prompts the user to switch the architecture listing in the PKGBUILD to the Debian styled one (which can be seen from the output of `dpkg --print-architecture`).
- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` with better guidelines.
- Require `pkgdesc` to not be empty and contain characters other than spaces.
- Show warning when `pkgdesc` or a maintainer entry isn't present in PKGBUILDs.
- Show warning when more than one maintainer is specified.
- Disallow distribution and architecture-specific variables from pairing up with each other (#150).
- Require sources with distribution or architecture extensions in the variable name to have a matching hashsum entry with the same extensions (#150).
- Update format of .SRCINFO files.

### Deprecated
- An architecture listing of `any` now sets the package architecture to the system's DPKG architecture (as required by the [Debian control file specification](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-architecture)). Previously `any` was automatically converted to `all` (which identifies an architecture-independent package), and using `all` now fulfills that purpose.
- Removed the `--ignorearch`, `--nodeps`, `--geninteg`, `-Q`/`--no-fields`, and `-v`/`--distro-packages` options. `--ignorearch`, `--nodeps`, and `--geninteg`, should now be replaced with their hyphen-separated counterparts, with those being `--ignore-arch`, `--no-deps`, and `--gen-integ` respectively. All other previously mentioned options have been fully removed.

### Fixed
- Implemented a changelog (#145).
- Moved all code to `src/makepkg` codebase (#130).
- Disabled all colored output if file descriptor 2 isn't a terminal (#81).
- Allow `pkgver` to include all characters allowed in the [Debian control file specification](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-version).
- Don't require `pkgver` to start with a number.
